    A <b>Java</b> fractal generator (currently UI-silent, with configuration through a file),
    that implements display of custom functions,
    with constant declaration processing, in Mandelbrot, Newton and Julia modes.

    There are 10 different colouring schemes, 5 of which use iteration renormalization with linear interpolation
    and 3 using spline interpolation for emphasis on outer regions, and 2 which render in grayscale for emphasis on inner regions.

    Resolution of the fractal is preferred to be in 2m+1x2n+1 format for proper symmetry.

<p>
    Supported modes: Julia, Mandelbrot, Newton, with Buddhabrot technique variations available for each.

    Newton fractal generator can handle simple polynomials with complex coefficients and exponents, but uses a different input format:
    {coefficient:variable:exponent};+;{coefficient:variable:exponent};-;{coefficient:variable:exponent},etc.

    Colors currently available are based on:
    <ol>
    <li>Division of 0xffffff by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)</li>
    <li>Bit-shift mode with results similar to division by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)</li>
    <li>High contrast mode</li>
    <li>Grayscale Mode</li>
    <li>Full custom or base-step gradient palette mode by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)</li>
    <li>Randomized palette mode by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)</li>
    </ol>

    Support for L-system fractals (IFS Affine Transform models such as the fern) has the framework in place and is scheduled for a future update.

    Multithreading -- A class enabling multithreaded fractal generation has been included, but there is no output.
    Will have to be debugged later

    More standard coloring methods are there, such as:
    <ol>
    <li>Triangle Area Inequality</li>
    <li>Curvature Average</li>
    <li>Stripe Average</li>
    </ol>
    Also, these modes support Catmull-Rom Spline interpolation.

    Distance Estimation has been included, but as it involves differentiation and so uses the same backend as Newton Fractals, it is subject to
    the same constraints on polynomials and style of input. This method produces black and white images by design.

    These coloring methods will affect only the palette-based methods of colouring.

    NOTES:
    The fractal generator has the basic framework for being extensible and being multithreaded,
    but it is currently single-threaded since multithreaded generation has some issues which need to be fleshed out.


    Also,there is full support for zoom, but renders after zoom are slow for higher base precision values. As a thumb rule, for quadrupling total resolution, double base precision for best results. Also, total scaling beyond 10<sup>4</sup> might not produce very detailed output, but then I haven't done very extensive tests.

    Default debug and progress is output to console, and the final image is saved as D:\Fractal.jpg.

    Please ensure that a writable D: drive is present in the system before running this program,
    as the only way to change the output location is to edit the source code of <code>Main</code> and rebuild the project.

    (Saving through the viewer is there but is disabled, and this does not have the above mentioned limitation of default output)
</p>

<p>
    There is also an included image viewer, which can also display fractals.

    There is support for elementary image transitions from top, bottom, left and right in the viewer,
    but it cannot be configured as of now through the main class. So, we basically have a fractal viewer, whose usage is currently commented out,
    due to overhead concerns.

    However, saving of the fractal image and zooming in the viewer are both supported but untested.
    All input to the application is currently handled by:

    <ol>
    <li>Editing the source of the Main test class</li>
    <li>Through a configuration file, whose path can be specified as an argument while running the application</li>
    </ol>

Image and Fractal display configuration files are a stickler for format, but do support inline comments with "#", as in .ini files.

<p>
    I did not have time to put in documenting comments. I'll start putting them in and updating files as they get ready.
