<head>A <b>Java</b> fractal generator (currently without an input/configuration ui, soon through a .ini file),
that implements display of custom functions,
with constant declaration processing, in both Mandelbrot and Julia modes.
There are 6 different colouring schemes, 5 of which use iteration renormalization with linear interpolation for emphasis on outer regions,
and 1 which renders in grayscale for emphasis on inner regions.
Resolution of the fractal is preferred to be in 2m+1x2n+1 format for proper symmetry.</head>

    Supported modes: Julia, Mandelbrot, Newton.
    Newton fractal generator can handle simple polynomials with complex coefficients and exponents, but uses a different input format:
    {coefficient,variable,exponent}+{coefficient,variable,exponent}-{coefficient,variable,exponent},etc.
    Colors currently available are based on:
    Division of 0xffffff by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)
    Bit-shift mode with results similar to division by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)
    High contrast mode
    Grayscale Mode
    Light blue palette mode by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)
    Deep blue palette mode by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)
    Randomized palette mode by fractional iteration count (interpolation available)

    Support for L-system fractals (IFS Affine Transform models such as the fern) has the framework in place and is scheduled for a future update.

    Multithreading -- I have an idea about how to go about it, I'll see what I can do

    More standard coloring methods are incoming, such as:
    Triangle Area Inequality
    Curvature Average
    Stripe Average

    Also, support is planned for Catmull-Rom Spline interpolation.

    These coloring methods will affect only the palette-based methods of colouring.

    NOTES:
    The fractal generator has the basic framework for being extensible and being multithreaded, but it is currently single-threaded since I'm not
    really sure about how well or correctly I can handle multithreading.

    Also,there is full support for zoom, but renders after zoom are slow if the input resolution is higher than 401x401 and very slow above 801x801.
    Not really sure about threaded prerenders, will have to ask someone for help with it.

    Default debug and progress is output to console, and the final image is saved as D:\Fractal.jpg.
    Please ensure that a writable D: drive is present in the system before running this program,
    as the only way to change the output location is to edit the source code of <code>Main</code> and rebuild the project.

    (Saving through the viewer is there but is disabled, and this does not have the above mentioned limitation of default output)

    There is also an included image viewer, which can also display fractals.

    There is support for elementary image transitions from top, bottom, left and right in the viewer,
    but it cannot be configured as of now through the main class. So, we basically have a fractal viewer, whose usage is currently commented out,
    due to overhead concerns.

    However, saving of the fractal image and zooming in the viewer are both supported but untested.
    All input to the application is currently handled by editing the source of the Main test class,or through a file, or through the command line
    (last 2 methods are untested).
    Image & Fractal display configuration files are a stickler for format, but are pretty much ready.
